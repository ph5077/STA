create_clock -period 5.0 [get_ports CK1]
  ## The source_object is where the clock exists
  ## usually an input port but can also be a pin inside the design.

report_transitive_fanout
  ## transitive fanout of the clock source object
  
report_transitive_fanin
  ## shows the successive driver and load pins in the path feeding into the sink object
  
set_propagated_clock [get_clocks CLK]
  ## enable calculation of propagated delay through the network using wire parasitic data
  ## propagate clock network delays, automatically determine latency at each reg clock pin

remove_clock
  ## remove a defined clock
  
reset_design 
  ## removes all clocks as well as other design information.
